      <h2>How to Use Emergency Numbers Effectively</h2>
      <p>
       Calling an emergency number is more than just dialing digits. To ensure a quick and effective response, follow these steps:
<ul>
<li>Stay calm and speak clearly. Panic can make it harder for responders to understand you.</li>
<li>Provide your exact location. Give clear details about your address, landmarks, or street name to avoid delays.</li>
<li>Describe the emergency (e.g., fire, medical crisis, accident, security threat).</li>
<li>Give your contact details. If the call disconnects, emergency responders may need to call you back.</li>
<li>Follow any instructions the operators may provide before help arrives.</li>
<li>If you cannot reach one service, consider calling another relevant agency. </li>
</ul>
</p>
