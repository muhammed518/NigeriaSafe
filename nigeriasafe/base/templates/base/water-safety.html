      <h2>Before You Get in the Water</h2>
      <p>
        Preparation is key to preventing accidents.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Learn to Swim:</strong> Ensure everyone in the family knows how to swim well. Enrolling in age-appropriate water orientation and learn-to-swim courses is one of the best ways to be safe.</li>
          <li><strong>Check Conditions:</strong> Look at local weather forecasts and check for warning flags at beaches. Avoid water during storms or high winds.</li>
          <li><strong>Choose Safe Areas:</strong> Always swim in designated areas supervised by lifeguards.</li>
          <li><strong>Wear Life Jackets:</strong> Inexperienced swimmers and boaters should always wear approved life jackets. Inflatable toys are not safety devices.</li>
          <li><strong>The Buddy System:</strong> Never swim alone. Always swim with a buddy so you can watch out for each other.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>While in the Water</h2>
      <p>
        Stay alert and follow safety rules.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Enter Feet First:</strong> If you don't know the depth of the water, jump in feet first. Diving into shallow water can cause serious spinal injuries.</li>
          <li><strong>Constant Supervision:</strong> Watch children constantly. For young children or weak swimmers, get in the water with them ("touch supervision").</li>
          <li><strong>Avoid Alcohol:</strong> Alcohol impairs judgment, balance, and coordination. Avoid it before or during swimming and boating activities.</li>
          <li><strong>Know Your Limits:</strong> Do not try to swim longer distances than you are capable of. If you feel cold or tired, get out of the water immediately.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Understanding Water Hazards</h2>
      <p>
        Be aware of specific dangers in different bodies of water.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rip Currents:</strong> These are powerful currents of water flowing away from shore. If caught in one, don't fight it. Swim parallel to the shore until you are out of the current, then swim back to land.</li>
            <li><strong>Cold Water Shock:</strong> Sudden immersion in cold water can cause gasping and rapid breathing, leading to drowning. Wear a life jacket to keep your head above water.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>Recognizing and Responding to Distress</h2>
      <p>
        Drowning doesn't look like it does in the movies. It is often silent.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Signs of Drowning:</strong> Look for a person whose head is low in the water, mouth at water level, or who is gasping. They may be vertical in the water but not using their legs.</li>
            <li><strong>"Reach, Throw, Don't Go":</strong> If someone is in trouble, do not jump in unless you are a trained lifeguard.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Reach:</strong> Use a long object (pole, branch) to reach them.</li>
                    <li><strong>Throw:</strong> Throw a life ring or floatable object.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Call for Help:</strong> Dial 112 immediately for emergency assistance.</li>
        </ul>
