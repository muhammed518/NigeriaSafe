      <h2>Before You Get in the Water</h2>
      <p>
        Learn to swim. Check weather and water conditions before going in.
        Always swim in designated areas supervised by lifeguards. Wear a life
        jacket when boating, regardless of swimming ability. Never swim alone;
        always bring a buddy.

      <h2>While in the Water</h2>
      <p>
        Enter water feet first. Do not dive into unknown bodies of water. Watch
        out for currents, waves, and underwater hazards. Avoid alcohol before or
        during swimming or boating. Supervise children closely and never leave
        them unattended near water.

      <h2>Recognizing and Responding to Distress</h2>
      <p>
        Know the signs of drowning, which can be silent. If someone is in
        trouble, call for help. Use the "Reach, Throw, Don't Go" method: try to
        reach the person with an object, throw them a flotation device, but do
        not enter the water to rescue them unless you are trained.
