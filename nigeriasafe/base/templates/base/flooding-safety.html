      <h2>Before a Flood</h2>
      <p>
        Understanding the "why" and "where" of your risk can save you thousands in damages.
        <ul>
          <li>Determine Your Flood Zone: Check Flood Map Service Center (or your local equivalent). Even if you aren't in a "high-risk" zone, 25% of all flood claims come from moderate-to-low-risk areas.</li>

<li>The "Go Bag" Essentials: </li>
  <p>
Documents: Store copies of birth certificates, insurance policies, and IDs in a waterproof "dry bag."
Power: A hand-crank radio and portable power banks.
Water: At least one gallon per person per day for at least three days. <br>
food: Non-perishable items like energy bars, canned goods, and dried fruits. <br>
First Aid: A basic kit with bandages, antiseptics, and any personal medications. <br>
</p>

<p>

</li>Property Mitigation:</li> <br>

Sumps & Valves: Install a sump pump with a battery backup. Install backwater valves on your sewer lines to prevent sewage from backing up into your drains (a common and messy flood byproduct). <br>
Utilities: If you have time, turn off electricity at the main breaker and gas at the main valve to prevent fires and explosions.

      <h2>During a Flood</h2>
         <p>
  Many people underestimate the force exerted by moving water. It isn't just "wet"—it is heavy and relentless.
  <ul>
    <li>Hidden Hazards: * Electrocution: If water reaches your electrical outlets, the water itself can become energized.</li>

 <li>Displacement: Floods often displace wildlife. Be aware of snakes, rodents, or insects seeking higher ground—potentially in your home.</li>

 <li>Vertical Evacuation: If you are trapped in a building, move to the highest floor. Only go to the roof if necessary. Do not climb into a closed attic, as you may become trapped by rising water.</li>
      </p>

    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>After a Flood</h2>
      <p>
  The danger doesn't evaporate when the water does.
  <ul>
    <li>Structural Integrity: Floodwaters can undermine foundations and cause "scour" around support beams. If you see new cracks in drywall or doors that won't close, the foundation may have shifted.</li>

 <li>The 24-48 Hour Window: This is the critical timeframe before mold begins to grow.</li>
 </ul>
</p>
 <p>
 Everything porous (carpet, padding, drywall, insulation) that touched floodwater usually needs to be discarded. <br>
Floodwater is often "Category 3" (Black Water), meaning it contains sewage, chemicals, and heavy metals.
