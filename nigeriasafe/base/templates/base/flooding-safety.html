      <p>
        Know your flood risk and elevation. Prepare a "go bag" with essentials.
        Secure your property by moving valuables to higher levels. Make a plan
        for your family and pets. Monitor weather reports from reliable sources.

      <h2>During a Flood</h2>
      <p>
        Evacuate immediately if told to do so. Never walk, swim, or drive
        through floodwaters. "Turn Around, Don't Drown!" Just six inches of
        moving water can knock you down, and one foot of moving water can sweep
        your vehicle away. Stay off bridges over fast-moving water.

      <h2>After a Flood</h2>
      <p>
        Return home only when authorities say it is safe. Avoid floodwaters as
        they may be contaminated or contain dangerous debris. Be aware of areas
        where floodwaters have receded as roads may have weakened and could
        collapse. Clean and disinfect everything that got wet.
