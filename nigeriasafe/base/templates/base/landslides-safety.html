      <h2>Before a Landslide</h2>
      <p>
        Landslides can occur quickly and with little warning. Being observant is your best defense.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Know the Warning Signs:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Doors or windows sticking or jamming for the first time.</li>
                    <li>New cracks appearing in plaster, tile, brick, or foundations.</li>
                    <li>Outside walls, walks, or stairs beginning to pull away from the building.</li>
                    <li>Slowly developing, widening cracks on the ground or on paved areas.</li>
                    <li>Bulging ground at the base of a slope.</li>
                    <li>Water breaking through the ground surface in new locations.</li>
                    <li>Fences, retaining walls, utility poles, or trees tilting or moving.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Listen to Nature:</strong> A faint rumbling sound that increases in volume is noticeable as the landslide nears. The ground may begin shifting under your feet.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare an Emergency Kit:</strong> Have a "go-bag" ready with documents, water, and essentials in case you need to evacuate quickly.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>During a Landslide</h2>
      <p>
        Your reaction time is critical.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stay Alert:</strong> Many landslide fatalities occur when people are sleeping. Listen to local news stations on a battery-powered radio for warnings of heavy rainfall.</li>
            <li><strong>Evacuate Immediately:</strong> If you suspect imminent danger, leave immediately. Inform neighbors if you can.</li>
            <li><strong>If You Are Indoors:</strong> Move to a second story if possible. Stay out of the path of the landslide.</li>
            <li><strong>If You Are Outdoors:</strong> Run across the slope (perpendicular to the flow), not down it. If escape is not possible, curl into a tight ball and protect your head.</li>
            <li><strong>Driving:</strong> Watch the road for collapsed pavement, mud, fallen rocks, and other indications of possible debris flows.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>After a Landslide</h2>
      <p>
        The danger may not be over even after the slide stops.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stay Away:</strong> Flooding or additional slides may occur after a landslide. Do not enter the slide area.</li>
            <li><strong>Check for Injured Persons:</strong> Look for injured and trapped persons near the slide, without entering the direct slide area. Direct professional rescuers to their locations.</li>
            <li><strong>Report Hazards:</strong> Look for and report broken utility lines and damaged roadways and railways to appropriate authorities.</li>
            <li><strong>Check Foundations:</strong> Check the building foundation, chimney, and surrounding land for damage.</li>
            <li><strong>Replanting:</strong> Replant damaged ground as soon as possible since erosion caused by loss of ground cover can lead to flash flooding and additional landslides.</li>
        </ul>
