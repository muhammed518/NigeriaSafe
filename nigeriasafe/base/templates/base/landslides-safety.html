      <p>
        Know if you live in an area prone to landslides. Look for warning signs
        such as new cracks in pavement or foundations, leaning trees or poles,
        and changes in water flow. Have an evacuation plan and an emergency kit
        ready.

      <p>
        Evacuate immediately if you suspect a landslide is imminent or if
        authorities issue an order. Move to higher ground away from the slide's
        path. If you cannot escape, curl into a tight ball and protect your head
        and neck with your arms.

        Stay away from the slide area as additional slides can occur. Check for
        injured or trapped persons near the slide without entering the slide
        area directly. Report broken utility lines and damaged roadways to the
        authorities. Listen to local radio for the latest emergency information.
