      <h2>Before a Fire</h2>
      <p>
        Create and practice a fire escape plan. Install smoke alarms on every
        level of your home, inside bedrooms and outside sleeping areas. Test
        them every month. Keep flammable items like paper, clothing, and
        curtains away from heat sources.

      <h2>During a Fire</h2>
      <p>
        If a fire occurs, get out and stay out. Crawl low under smoke to your
        exit. Feel doors for heat before opening them. If the fire is small and
        you are trained, use a fire extinguisher. Otherwise, evacuate
        immediately and call for help from outside.

      <h2>After a Fire</h2>
      <p>
        Do not re-enter a fire-damaged building until it has been declared safe
        by authorities. Contact your local disaster relief service for help with
        immediate needs. Check with the fire department to make sure your
        utilities are safe to use.
