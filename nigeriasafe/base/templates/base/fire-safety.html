      <h2>Before a Fire</h2>
      <h3>
      The goal here is to make your home a difficult place for a fire to start and an easy place to escape.

<h3>The "Rule of Three" for Alarms:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Placement: One on every floor, one in every bedroom, and one in the hallway outside sleeping areas.</li>
<li>Interconnection: If possible, use interconnected alarms. If one goes off in the basement, they all go off.</li>
<li>Maintenance: Vacuum your alarms. Dust buildup can cause false triggers or, worse, prevent them from sensing real smoke.</li>
<li>The 3-Foot Rule: Keep anything that can burn (blankets, rugs, paper) at least 3 feet away from heating equipment like furnaces, fireplaces, wood stoves, or portable space heaters.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Escape Plan Specifics:
</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Two Ways Out: Every room should have two potential exits (usually a door and a window).</li>
<li>The Meeting Spot: Pick a permanent landmark out front (a specific tree, the mailbox, or a neighbor’s porch). This prevents "hero syndrome" where someone runs back inside thinking someone is still trapped.</li>
   </ul>

      <h2>During a Fire</h2>
      <p>
       <strong> In a fire, you usually have less than two minutes to exit safely once the alarm sounds.</strong> <br>
       The Physics of Smoke: Smoke contains toxic gases and heat that can reach 600°C at the ceiling. <br>
       Crawl Low: The cleanest air is 12 to 24 inches above the floor. <br>
       Door Safety (The "Back of Hand" Test): Never use your palm to check a door; if it's hot, you'll burn your palm and be unable to use that hand to crawl or climb. Use the back of your hand to feel the door, the knob, and the crack between the door and the frame.
         </p>
         <P>
        
      <strong> P.A.S.S. Method (Extinguisher Use): </strong> <br>Only fight the fire if it's contained (like a wastebasket) and you have a clear exit behind you.
         <ol>
        <li>Pull the pin.</li>
        <li>Aim low at the base of the fire.</li>
        <li>Squeeze the lever.</li>
        <li>Sweep from side to side.</li>
          </ol>

      <h2>After a Fire</h2>
      <p>
      <strong>Once the flames are out, the danger isn't necessarily gone.</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Invisible Hazard: Fire-damaged structures often have compromised electrical wiring or gas leaks. Even if the lights turn on, don't use them until an electrician clears the house.</li>

<li>Document Everything: Before you start cleaning, take photos of everything for insurance purposes.</li>

<li>Air Quality: Smoke damage isn't just a smell; it’s soot and particulates that are hazardous to your lungs. Professional "soot restoration" is usually required for textiles and walls.</li>

<li>Emotional Support: Fires are traumatic. Organizations like the Red Cross provide not just blankets and food, but also mental health resources to help process the loss.</li>
 </ul>
