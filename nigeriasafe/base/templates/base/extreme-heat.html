      <h2>Preparing for Extreme Heat</h2>
      <p>
       Preparing your home is about managing radiant heat (sunlight) and convection (air movement).
       <ul>
       <li> Reflective Shielding: Window reflectors (like the silver foil ones for cars) reflect up to 80% of incoming solar radiation. Light-colored curtains are better than dark ones, as dark fabrics absorb heat and radiate it back into the room.</li>

<li>The Fan Fallacy: Fans do not cool the air; they cool you by accelerating the evaporation of sweat. However, once the ambient temperature exceeds 35°C (95°F), fans can actually speed up dehydration by blowing air that is hotter than your body temperature across your skin.</li>

<li>Insulation: Weatherstrip doors and windows to keep the cool air in and the "heat soak" out.</li>
       </ul>

      <h2>Staying Safe During Extreme Heat</h2>
      <p>
      Your body’s primary cooling mechanism is evaporative cooling. If you stop sweating, you are in immediate danger.
      <ul>
      <li> Strategic Hydration: Don't wait for thirst—that’s a late-stage signal. Avoid caffeine and alcohol, which act as diuretics and can worsen dehydration.</li>
        <li>The "Vascular Cooling" Trick: To cool down fast, run cool water over your "pulse points"—wrists, neck, and temples. These areas have blood vessels close to the surface, helping to lower your core temperature more efficiently. </li>
        <li> Vehicle Safety: Even on a mild 21°C (70°F) day, the inside of a car can reach 40°C (104°F) in just 20 minutes. Cracking the windows has a negligible effect on temperature reduction.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Recognizing Heat-Related Illnesses</h2>
      <p>
It is vital to distinguish between Exhaustion (your body is struggling) and Stroke (your body’s cooling system has failed). <br>

Symptom Comparison <br>

Heat Exhaustion | Heat Stroke (Emergency!) <br>
Skin  Moist, pale, and clammy | Dry, hot, and red Sweating <br>
 Heavy sweating | No sweating (usually) <br>
 Mental State Normal or slightly faint | Confused, combative, or unconscious <br>
 Pulse Fast and weak | Fast and strong <br>
 Body Temp Below 39°C (103°F) | Above 39°C (103°F)
