      <h2>Preparing for Extreme Heat</h2>
      <p>
        Prepare your home by checking that your fans or air conditioning units
        are working. Install window reflectors or use light-colored curtains to
        reflect heat. Know the locations of public cooling centers. Plan to do
        outdoor activities during cooler parts of the day.

      <h2>Staying Safe During Extreme Heat</h2>
      <p>
        Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water, even if you don't feel
        thirsty. Wear lightweight, loose-fitting, and light-colored clothing.
        Avoid strenuous activities and stay indoors in a cool place as much as
        possible. Never leave children or pets in a parked car.

      <h2>Recognizing Heat-Related Illnesses</h2>
      <p>
        Know the signs of heat exhaustion (heavy sweating, weakness, dizziness,
        nausea) and heat stroke (high body temperature, confusion, loss of
        consciousness). Heat stroke is a medical emergency; call for help
        immediately. Move the person to a cooler place and help lower their
        temperature with cool cloths or a cool bath.
